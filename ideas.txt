Ideas to introduce in the future code:

Pov used the logistic growth equation from https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/download/v033i07/367
This way he was able to calculate curve parameters:
    - lambda: length of lag phase
    - mu: growth rate
    - A: max. cell growth

Parametric growth model:
Introduce more than one model of growth (logistic, Gompertz, mod Gompertz, Richards...)
Compare the models with AIC and select best one

Implement a model-free method of spline/trapezoid integration for AUC.
Calculate the same parameters using splines.

Bootstrap method to get confidence intervals?


Multi-variate tests:
    - PCA
    - t-SNE
    - Clustering with K-means? (useful when we don't know about the samples?)
